# Code With Me

![code with me](./media/code-with-me.png)

Like Code Labs but with more polish and more How-Tos from an expert Fluter app designer and developer perspective, as that should have been what Code Labs should be.

As this is a mature front-end app market, so you guys and gals new to Flutter should have a code labs experience that is somewhat both developer and designer high professionally polished.  

## About Me, Fred Grott

I am a re-formed native Android App Developer and a re-formed ADHD creative.

There are two types of people in this world, consumers and creators. Consumers have all the troubles of the world with all that non creative posion in their brains.  Creatives live more interesting vibrant lives full of creative dreams instead of poison in their heads.

My current free stuff on flutter as fas as code and creative assets is at my code-with-me GitHub repositiory at:

In both Front End Development and Creative Life the contexts and the path have gems of insight that is not from you own paths. To get that insight you need access to my articles in these simple two steps:

1. Sign up for a paid Medium subscription at my subscription link:
