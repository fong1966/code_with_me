# Code With Me

![code with me](./media/code-with-me.png)

Like Code Labs but with more polish and more How-Tos from an expert Fluter app designer and developer perspective, as that should have been what Code Labs should be.

As this is a mature front-end app market, so you guys and gals new to Flutter should have a code labs experience that is somewhat both developer and designer high professionally polished.
